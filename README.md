# PackPackGo

Building a JavaScript project should be easy. We want to spend our weekends building stuff, not configuring Webpack. PackPackGo is a Webpack GUI that makes building your JavaScript project as easy as playing mp3.

Simply drop your project into PackPackGo, and click play. The yellow ducky will build your project.

Refresh your browser automatically whenever you make new changes.

When you are done, click "bundle", and the yellow ducky will give you a minified, transpiled, polyfilled bundle.

Pack it, and go!
