# PackPackGo

PackPackGo is a Webpack GUI that makes building your JavaScript project as easy as playing mp3.

Drop your project into PackPackGo, and click play. You project will build, and the browser will automatically refresh whenever you make new changes. You don't need to configure anything.

When you are done, click "bundle" for production release. You'll get a minified, transpiled, polyfilled bundle.

Pack it, and go!
